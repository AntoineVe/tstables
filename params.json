It stores time\r\nseries data into daily partitions and provides functions to query for subsets of data across\r\npartitions.\r\n\r\nIts goals are to support a workflow where tons (gigabytes) of time series data are \r\nappended periodically to a HDF5 file, and need to be read many times (quickly) for analytical models\r\nand research.\r\n\r\n## Not ready for use yet\r\n\r\nTsTables is not ready for use yet and is currently under development. The goal is to have something\r\nworkable and being testing by end of May, 2014. If you are interested in the project (to contribute\r\nor learn when it is finished), email Andy Fiedler at <andy@andyfiedler.com>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
